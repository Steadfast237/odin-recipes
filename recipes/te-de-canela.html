    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I have been drinking te de canela, or cinnamon tea, since I was a kid. My
      mother always made it for us when we had a sore throat, a fever or just
      because. This cinnamon tea can be sweetened with honey, sugar, or
      piloncillo, which is Mexican brown sugar, and we often added a squeeze of
      fresh lemon juice. As adults the tea is spiked with pure cane alcohol,
      which is very common amongst Hispanic people.
